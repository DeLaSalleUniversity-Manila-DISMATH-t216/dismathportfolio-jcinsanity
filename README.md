#Session 1 (Feb. 3, 2016)

- I learned today that Java Language is also used in Object Oriented Programming.
- Java Programming also deals with objects and not structures unlike C programming.
- Class is the blueprint of the main program while the Object itself is the actual thing in the program
- Differences between C and Java:
	- C Language is faster and better when it comes to structured and because it is machine dependent, it will definitely go through the machine automaticallu
	- C Language needs to recompile when being used to another OS.
	- Java is not a machine-directly but can be run in different OS.
	- Java also needs Java Virtual Machine in order to communicate with the machine unlike C Prog.
- Public Classes can be accessed by any other classes while Private is only accessible to a certain class.
- I also learned the Basic Commands in linux(terminal) like:
	- ` $ ls ` will list all the files and folders in the directory.
  
	- ` $ mkdir ` will create a new directory.
  
	- ` $ cd ` changes directory path
  
	- ` $ rm ` to erase or remove a file or folder. 
	- ` $ mv ` to move a file.
  
	- ` $ pwd ` to check if directory exists.
  
	- ` $ clear ` will clear the terminal.
  
	- ` $ sudo apt-get install program ` will install a desired program.
  
	- ` $ javac ` to compile the source code.
  
	- ` $ java ` to run the source code.
- I am also excited to learn more about Java Programming in the next meetings ahead.
#Introduction
#CODES 
- [TruthTable] (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Booleans)

#Session 2 (Feb. 10, 2016)
###Primitives

- Primitive data types are int, float, double, byte, boolean, char, etc.
- I also learned that Boolean principle are typed of data types that can accept only true or false.
- When you code, it's important to to use or to determine Upper and Lower case to modify the purpose or inside the input.
- java.oi class will be able to get any inputs from the user.
- Exercises
- [Characters] (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Character)
- [SimpleCalculator] (https://github.com/jcinsanity/SimpleCalculator)
- [StringOutput] (https://github.com/jcinsanity/StringOut)

#Session 3 (Feb. 12, 2016)
###SyntaxandFlow

- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Conditionals)
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Loop)
- Types of Loops:
	- The conventional For-Loop:
    
		- ` for (condition){statement} `
  
	- The Each-For-Loop:
    
		- ` for(:){statement} `
  
	- The While-Loop:
    
		- ` While (condition){statement} `
  
	- The Do-While-Loop:
    
		- ` Do {statement} While (condition); `
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/SwitchC) - It is essential to use loops in swtich cases. You can use strings or integer.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/MethodsWithArg)  && (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Method) were discussed and methods are functions in C which can pass an argument.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Calculator02) - We also made a second version of Calculator.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/MethodOverolading)


#Session 4 (Feb. 15, 2016)
###ComplexObejects

- We learned more about complex data types like Strings and Dates.

- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/String) - The use of an equal sign, and by the use of new instance can be one of the ways to declare a string.    
- You can also convert string into an array of characters using the `toCharArray` function.

- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/StringBuilders) - Allows you to add a preset string on user's input using of String Builder.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/ParsingStrings) - You can get the total length of a string, cut the string, or the position of a certain word in the string. 
- In java, you can automatically get or print the current date using the Date Utility.


#Session 5 (
Feb. 17, 2016)
###Debugging

- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Error) - There are types of Error like compile time error where there is something wrong with the code while compiling and, run time error where it occurs when it is running.
- We use IntelliJ because it's like Eclipse and it can help debugging errors and it can help you find the bug.
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/Exception) Using try-catch, it will execute the statements but it will output a message when a bug has occured just like If-Else statement.
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/ThrowingException) - In this program, I learn that catching the error can be places in several and many methods.
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/Debugger.)


#Session 6 (Feb. 19, 2016)
###Collections

- In, DATASAL, I learned the Array list is easier and more efficient than Linked List and I didn't knew that I'm gonna use this also in Java!
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/SimpleArrays) - So Array List is more Efficient then Linked List.
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/2DArray) - Java supports MultiDimensional Arrays like 2-D Arrays or Objects of Arrays.
- Fix Memory Size - for some arrays.
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/HashMaps) - is a combination or 2-D Array, and an Array List
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/Iterator) - to list down every values in an array list.
- https://github.com/jcinsanity/ArrayList.)


#Session 7 (Feb. 19, 2016)
###CustomClasses

- In this Exercise, I learn on how to minimize my code by using seperate classes.
- in (https://github.com/jcinsanity/CustomClass) - It is easier for me to know the functions of my code because I literally debug my code if something goes wrong.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/InstanceVariables) - Instance variable is defined in a class and belongs to an object.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/InstanceMethods) - It will work as an object completely.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Packages.) - You need to make packages to manage well your codes and to know the classes to sub-classes.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/Constructors) - It's just like Instance Method but the difference is that it has no return type.
- (https://github.com/jcinsanity/GettersAndSetter) - While setters sets a new field of memory, getters gets the private field of memory.
